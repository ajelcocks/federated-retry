# Dynamic import

Webpack creates a cache of dynamically imported modules.

This can be a problem when using federated modules since the load can fail at runtime because
the code generated by webpack will return the failure if the dynamic import is re-executed.

This plugin removes the failed import from the webpack cache, forcing a reload.
